This upgrade has been a few months in the making.  My current daily driver desktop is an AM4 based system on an older MSI B550 motherboard, today we're going to upgrade that to X570 and hopefully add some functionality

## Testing

### Boot Disk Clone

To validate that nothing would go nuclear at the OS level, I'm testing the windows install by cloning my boot disk and using that on the new board before migrating everything.  I used a [Clonezilla live image](https://clonezilla.org/fine-print-live-doc.php?path=clonezilla-live/doc/03_Disk_to_disk_clone) and everything went smoothly from there.

### BIOS tweaks

## **Thunderbolt**

### Multi Monitor?

Short answer: not yet.

While we're able to successfully pass a single display signal through using the DisplayPort connection from the Radeon 6800XT, getting multiple displays out of the dock is still a work in progress.  In theory it should be possible (a previous test with a laptop was able to get multiple out without any issue) as the GPU supports DSC and outputs over DP1.4.
